## Vimcasts Downloader

[Vimcasts][1] is an incredible resource for levelling up your VIM skills, but I always want to binge on episodes in a playlist style. That isn't possible on the blog where they are hosted - so this script pulls them down and stores them all locally in order of release.

Pretty straightforward really.
